# Hybrid template

This is a TypeScript template for building quality multiplatform apps. It uses the following technologies:

- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- - [Vue I18n](https:https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) - Internationalization (translations, date/time formatting, number formatting)
- - [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/) - Form validation
- [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) - UI, Routing
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication, Database, Storage, Analytics. Firebase firestore is used as a direct (realtime) datastore (replaces pinia / vue).
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) - Native API access, Build, Deploy

## Why this template?

The purpose of this template is to serve as a starting point for building quality multiplatform apps. It handles all the time-consuming tasks like setting up routing, authentication, database access, storage access, analytics, internationalization, form validation, app subscriptions, capacitor settings etc. This way you can focus on the actual app logic and UI.
